## Stack and Queue - 4/26/2020
Implement Stack and Queue data structures by using Linked List. Write push, pop, peek, and isEmpty methods for Stack and write enqueque, dequeque, peek, and isEmpty method for Queue.

  ### Challenge Description
  Implement Stack and Queue by using Linked List not Array.

  ### Approach & Efficiency
  * Approach:
    * Stack: has top property and initial value is null.
      1. push method: If it is empty Stack, then points top at new node. If it is not empty Stack, then new node's next points at current top and then make top points at new node. Time Complexity: O(1).
      2. pop method: If it is empty Stack, then return null. If it is not empty Stack, then return top's value and make top points at top's next node. Time Complexity: O(1).
      3. peek method: If it is empty Stack, then return null. If it is not empty Stack, then return top's value. Time Complexity: O(1).
      4. isEmpty method: If top is null, then return true, else return false. Time Complexity: O(1).
    * Queue: has front and rear properties and both initial values are null.
      1. enqueque method: If it is empty Queue, then points both front and rear at new node. If it is not empty Queue, then rear's next points at new node and then make rear point at new node. Time Complexity: O(1).
      2. dequeque method: If it is empty Queue, then return null. If it is not empty Queue, then return front's value and make front points at front's next node. Time Complexity: O(1).
      3. peek method: If it is empty Queue, then return null. If it is not empty Queue, then return front's value. Time Complexity: O(1).
      4. isEmpty method: If front is null, then return true, else return false. Time Complexity: O(1).
  * Test: Run command 'jest \_\_tests\_\_/stack-and-queue.test.js --verbose --coverage' from root directory. Test coverage is 100%.

  ### Methods
  * Stack: FILO
    1. push method: Add a node and make it top. Time complexity is O(1).
    2. pop method: Delete the top node and return its value. If it is empty Stack, then return null. Time complexity is O(1).
    3. peek method: Return top node's value. If it is empty Stack, then return null. Time complexity is O(1).
    4. isEmpty method: Return true if it is Empty Stack, return false if it is not. Time complexity is O(1).
  * Queue: FIFO
    1. enqueue method: Add a node in the rear. Time complexity is O(1).
    2. dequeue method: Delete the front node and return its value. If it is empty Queue, then return null. Time complexity is O(1).
    3. peek method: Return front node's value. If it is empty Queue, then return null. Time complexity is O(1).
    4. isEmpty method: Return true if it is empty Queue, return false if it is not. Time complexity is O(1).

## Reverse a linked list - 4/23/2020
Write a function that would reverse a given linked list. Do not use build-in method.

  ### Challenge Description
  Find a in-place solution without copy input linked list.

  ### Approach & Efficiency
  * Approach:
    * Traversing over the linked list and storing a reference to a current node, its previous node, and its next node.
    * In every iteration, after the next node is stored, the currentâ€™s node next pointer is pointed at the stored reference to the previous node. 
  * Time Complexity: O(n).
  * Test: Run command 'jest \_\_tests\_\_/reverseLL.test.js  --verbose --coverage' from root directory.

  ### Solution

## k-th value from the end of the linked list - 4/21/2020
Implement Singly Linked List and its append and kthFromEnd method. Write unit test for all methods.

  ### Challenge Description
  Find k-th value from the end of the linked list not from start of the linked list. Since linked list is uni-directional so we can only traverse linked list from head to last node. I need to find a way to record each node's value in reverse order.

  ### Approach & Efficiency
  * Approach:
    * Handle edge case. if k < 0, then return 'Exception'.
    * Traverse LL from head to last node.
    * unshifit current node's value to a temp array(initially empty) in each iteration.
    * After finish traversing, if k < temp.length then return temp[ k ], else return 'Exception'.
  * Time Complexity: O(n).
  * Test: Run command 'jest \_\_tests\_\_/ll-kth-from-end.test.js --verbose --coverage' from root directory.

  ### Solution

## Linked List insertions - 4/20/2020
Implement Singly Linked List and its append, insertBefore, and insertAfter method. Write unit test for all methods.

  ### Challenge Description
  Handle the edge cases. Make sure insertBefore could add a node before head and insertAfter could add a node after last node.

  ### Approach & Efficiency
  * Approach:
    * Create Node class with value and next property.
    * Create Linked List class with head property.
    * append method: If it is empty Linked list then assign new node to head. If not, traverse to the last node and add new node to last node.
    * insertBefore method: Traverse the linked list from head to last node and check if current node's value is equal to target value. If eqaul and if current node is head then make new node points at current node and make new node head. If equal and if current node is not head then make previous node points at new node and new node points at current node. If current node value is not equal to target value then move to the next node and do the above step.
    * insertAfter method: Traverse the linked list from head to last node and check if current node's value is equal to target value. If equal and if current node is last node then make current node points at new node. If equal and if current node is not last node then make current node points at new node and new node points at next node. If current node value is not equal to target value then move to next node and do the above step.
  * Time Complexity: 
    * append method: O(n)
    * insertBefore method: O(n)
    * insertAfter method: O(n)
  * Test: Run command 'jest \_\_tests\_\_/ll-insertions.test.js' from root directory.

## Singly Linked List - 4/19/2020
Implement Singly Linked List and its append, insert, includes, toString method

  ### Challenge Description
  Write unit test for all methods I created.

  ### Approach & Efficiency
  * Approach:
  I created Node and Linked List class first and then created append method. I used while loop to traverse linked list and using traversing and append method to build result of the method.
  * Time Complexity:
    * append method: O(n)
    * insert method: O(1)
    * includes method: O(n)
    * toString method: O(n)
  * Test: Run command 'jest \_\_tests\_\_/linked-list.test.js' from root directory.

  ### Linked List Methods
  * append(value): add a node to the end of the linked list
  * insert(value): insert a new head to the linked list
  * includes(value): inspect if the value exists in the linked list
  * toString(): returns a string that representing all the values in the linked list, formatted as: '{ 1 } -> { 2 } -> { 3 } -> NULL'.

## nth Fibonacci number (2 ways) - 4/16/2020
Generate the nth Fibonacci number in two different ways. This function takes a non-negative integer as input and output an integer

  ### Challenge Description
  Solve the problem in two different ways in 20 minutes.

  ### Approach & Efficiency
  * Approach1: Iterative method
    * Initialize result array with [0, 1].
    * Iterate over index from 2 to given input n. For each iteration, result[ i ] = result[i - 1] + result[i - 2].
    * Return result[ n ] after finish iteration.
  * Apporach2: recursive method
    * For given input n, if n is equal to 0, then return 0.<br/>If n is equal to 1, then return1.<br/>If n is larger than 1, then return f(n-1) + f(n-2).
  * Time complexity of iterative method is n (Linear).
  * Test: Run command 'jest \_\_tests\_\_/nth-fibonacci.test.js' from root directory.

  ### Solution

## Array Binary Search - 4/15/2020
Binary search a sorted array. This function takes a sorted array and a target number. If traget number exist, then return the index of target number in the arry. If not, then return -1.

  ### Challenge Description
  Implement binary search to achieve log n time complexity.

  ### Approach & Efficiency
  * Approach: 
    * Compare target number with mid index element in the input array. 
    * If they are equal, then return the current mid index. 
    * If target number is smaller than mid index number, then binary search only left portion of the array. 
    * If target number is larger than mid index number, then binary search only right portion of the array. 
    * If didn't find the target number, then return -1.
  * Time complexity of this approach is log n.
  * Test: Run command 'jest \_\_tests\_\_/array-binary-search.test.js' from root directory.

  ### Solution
  ![binary search](assets/array-binary-search.png "binarySearch")<br/>
